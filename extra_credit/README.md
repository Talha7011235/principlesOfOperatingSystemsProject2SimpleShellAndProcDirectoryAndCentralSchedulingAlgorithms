The "extra_credit" part of Project 2 includes the following C files to compile in VirtualBox Debian Terminal:

HussainTalha_forkSampleCProgramExtraCreditPartOne.c
HussainTalha_3forks.c
HussainTalha_forkExperiment.c

All the three .c programs listed above run and are invoked by using the commands that are associated and listed in the "Makefile" to each one
of these .c programs.

First, to build the fork Sample C Program that is documented and needs to be used for Part 1 in the Extra Credit section of Project 2,
enter "make forkSampleCProgramExtraCreditPartOne". Then, to execute the fork Sample C Program that is documented in Extra Credit section of
Project 2, type the command "./forkSampleCProgramExtraCreditPartOne" which builds the forkSampleCProgramExtraCreditPartOne executable file.

Second, to build HussainTalha_3forks.c, enter "make 3forks". Then, to execute HussainTalha_3forks.c, type the command "./3forks" which
builds the 3forks executable file.

Third, to build HussainTalha_forkExperiment.c, enter "make forkExperiment". Then to execute HussainTalha_forkExperiment.c, type the
command "./forkExperiment" which builds the forkExperiment executable file.
